/**
 * Most of the Excel streams or substreams are divided into records. Each record
 * contains specific data for the various contents or features in a document. It
 * consists of a header specifying the record type and size, followed by the
 * record data.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Common structure of a BIFF record:
 *  Offset 	Size 	Contents  
 *  0	2	Identifier  
 *  2 	2 	Size of the following data (sz)  Record header  
 *  4 	sz	Record data
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The maximum size of the record data is limited and depends on the BIFF
 * version. If the size of the record data exceeds the current limit, one or
 * more CONTINUE records will be added. Inside a CONTINUE record the data of the
 * previous record continues as usual.<br/> For low memory use,we didn't store
 * record,we just parse it.If the record is a control record.record parser
 * control the parser stream or change something like close the steam if we met
 * EOF record.If the record is a content record like SST record the parser will
 * parse it and store the content to somewhere.
