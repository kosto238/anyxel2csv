 * This record stores the range of used rows and stream positions of several
 * records of the current sheet. In particular the position of the first
 * DEFINEDNAME record and XF record is stored (BIFF2-BIFF4) and the position of
 * a specific record in each Row Block (the first ROW record in BIFF2-BIFF4, and
 * the DBCELL record in BIFF5-BIFF8). This stream position array also contains
 * stream offsets to empty Row Blocks, they will point to the next extant Row
 * Block.The number of entries nm in this array can be calculated from the row
 * range given in this record (rf is the index to the first used row, rl is the
 * index to the first row of unused tail of sheet): nm = (rl - rf + 1) / 32 + 1
 * (using integer division).
 * 
 * <pre>
 * offset Size Contents
 *  	4 	Not used
 *  	4 	Index to first used row (rf, 0-based)
 *  	4 	Index to first row of unused tail of sheet (rl, last used row + 1, 0-based)
 * 2 	4 	Absolute stream position of the DEFCOLWIDTH record  of the current sheet. If
 * 	this record does not exist, the offset points to the record at the position where the
 * 	DEFCOLWIDTH record would occur.
 * 6 	4+6*nm 	Array of nm absolute stream positions to the DBCELL record  of each Row Block
